This week I'm reading *The Trusted Advisor*, by David H. Maister, Charles H. Green, & Robert M. Galford. Sometimes when I imagine books in the genre of "business self-help", I imagine content which makes everyone involved in the business process feel mechanical and I wonder who behaves in this fashion. I was pleasantly surprised though to find a strong emphasis in *The Trusted Advisor* on the client/advisor relationship as a more personal relationship. In fact, the book is entirely framed in the context of building and maintaining a very human relationship built on trust.
<br><br>
### Characteristics of Trust

At the beginning of their book, Maister et al. outline the characteristics of trust:

> 1. Grows, rather than just appears
> 2. Is both rational and emotional
> 3. Presumes a two-way relationship
> 4. Is intrinsically about perceived risk
> 5. Is different for the client than it is for the advisor
> 6. Is personal

Their definition of trust looks much like the trust between friends or romantic partners. Indeed, Maister et al. draw anecdotes from personal relationships to illustrate the advisor/client relationship as a personal relationship. Through trust building, an advisor can progress (or at least strive to progress) their client relationship from service offering-based to needs-based to relationship-based, and finally to trust-based (the pinnacle).

Before looking at how to build trust, I want to point out one item from the list I find particularly interesting: trust is different for the client than it is for the advisor. In a trust-based relationship, "...one does the trusting, and one is trusted." I think it's tempting for people to say, "Why don't you trust me?" without considering this dynamic. The client has personal risks for trusting you: "reputation, promotion opportunities, bonuses..." Empathy is important to me, so this is something I personally want to keep in mind.

### How to Build Trust?

In the middle portion of the book, Maister et al. point out what they believe are *key* stages in building trust.

> 1. Engage
> 2. Listen
> 3. Frame
> 4. Envision
> 5. Commit

**Engagement** is the first step in building trust and "...the point in the process where the client begins to feel two things: (1) There is an issue worth talking about; and (2) This person is worth talking to on that issue." The client establishes that the advisor is worth talking to; the advisor earns the right to move into a discussion of client needs.

**Listening** "...is essential to 'earn the right' to comment on and be involved with client's issues." Maister et al. really emphasize the idea that you must be self-confident enough to listen without pre-judging/interrupting. As they say, "...it takes self-confidence to wait and believe that after listening and brainstorming, we will still have ample time and talent to discover the technical answer." Basically, the client is telling you a story. By interrupting with immediate problem solving, you interrupt the meaning of the story.  "Good listening respects the speaker by respecting the sequence of the story he or she chooses to tell us."

**Framing the issue** is about "...encapsulating the client's complex issues (and emotions) into a problem definition." It is in this problem definition where Maister et al. say the clients typically begins to recognize the value being added by the advisor, leading to a significant building of trust.

**Envisioning an alternate reality**: what does that mean? (This one sounded the most foreign to me at first.) "Having defined the problem, some might think that the next logical step is to solve it." A problem might have many solutions, but how would the client/advisor know if go immediately from framing the issue to solving the problem? Envisioning an alternative reality allows for jointly envisioning alternatives and further exploring client needs. Advisors can add value and build trust by clarifying expectations, either by "getting the client to expand his or her dreams," or (in the other direction) by managing expectations which may be unrealistic.

**Commitment** is the last stage in building trust. Commitment in this case means "...[ensuring] that the client understands what will be necessary to solve the problem and is willing to do what it takes to achieve the goals." Commitment is about a candid representation and mutual understanding of expectations, challenges, and risks.

Many times during the course of my reading, I found myself recalling this quote from German philosopher Immanuel Kant:
   
> *Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.*  

A lot of *The Trusted Advisor* has this sort of sentiment to me.  I really appreciate their approach, and I don't think I've done it justice. So, I recommend advisors checking out this book for themselves.
